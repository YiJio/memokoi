**TL;DR:** Saved resources/sites list with tab count browser extension/add-on.

**Summary:** This will save sites for future easy access to the site again. It also displays a tab count for each saved site if there are tabs opened so that the user knows if there was already one opened (to better minimize open tabs).

**Description:** Simple add-on for saved resources/sites list with a tab count that tells you if you already have that site opened. Use this to save frequently accessed sites or a site you can't remember the name of. Add keywords to help with remembering what the site does.
